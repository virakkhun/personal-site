In 2023, I've playing with a lot of tech stack and also framework has incrementally increasing over the year, some of the them are very interesting to try out. But here I'm going to talk about stack that I've been using in production both in my full time job and side project. I will categorize into two main category.","> **at workplace**

I started at [Okoone](https://okoone.com) in 2023 as a Software Engineer, specifically I do front-end work. so [Angular](https://angular.dev) is the main framework we used, as it very mature, stable, enterprise ready and backed by the google. Before, [nuxt](https://nuxt.com) was a framework I used in the old company to build some ssr website. Coming from a [vue](https://vue.org) kind of functional way, to me is a very big different which I have to learn everything from the ground again by reading documentation and learn from the project as well. It's been a year now since I started to use **Angular** and I would say that the experience was not so bad, as I'm very comfortable writing stuff in **Angular** currently and also comfortable with the project. It was hard at first because the project is very big and there is a lot of stuff that has been done and super abstraction which was hard to get the head around. But I learned a lot from the project because there are a set of rule, guideline, best practice and quality of code. I thought **Angular** was never be fun to work with because it's very big framework, confusing API, and a big bundle ship to the production. But it turned out very fun to work with it. We can do a lot of thing with it, easy and convenient to work with because of its ecosystem, such as its **CDK**, allow us to build a reusable UI component. **routing**, **form** is great thing to work with in **Angular**. In my opinion, **Angular** has become better as they have brought the **signal**, a new reactivity system, **vite** & **esbuild** as a build tool, making development more faster, and building for production faster, better DX with a new `@if`, `@for`, `@defer` and a lot of stuff.

**my takeway**

- great framework
- great ecosystem
- suitable for any kind of project, especially for big, complex project
- a lot of thing built-in
- great for team

> **side project & learning**

#### Frontend Stack

[**SvelteKit**](https://kit.svelte.dev) is used in my side project, basically this website is using **SvelteKit V1**. It is one of the best meta framework in the javascript community that I've been using it. The route file based, providing such an amazing DX, very light weight, typescript support and ready for production. It offers a ton of feature such as, **_form action_**, **_data fetching_**, **_SSR & CSR & SSG_**, **_state management_** and great DX.

I've also used [**solid**](https://solidjs.com) to build some dashboard, it is very great framework, light weight and performance as well. Reactivity is great, back by the **\*signal**, very powerful. I will use it more and deep dive into the framework more in 2024. [**SolidStart**](https://start.solidjs.com/getting-started/what-is-solidstart) is also coming on the way too, very excited.

#### Backend Stack

[**go**](https://go.dev/) aka Golang, I've used **go** and [fiber](https://gofiber.io/) to build some api, it is fast and performance and will deep dive more in 2024. There are a lot of cool stuff in languages.

#### Other thing

- [vercel](https://vercel.com) is my favorite platform to deploy the front-end.
- [supabase](https://supabase.com) well, i store all my blog post in there, super great.
- [cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) for managing domain, dns and stuff.
