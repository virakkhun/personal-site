	<p class="font-bold underline text-orange-500">A little bit about Me</p>
	<p class="ml-4">
		My name is <span class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-300">Virak</span>, most people called me
		<i>"Virak"</i>. I am from Sihanouk Province (aka Kompong Som). My high school was Hun Sen Prey
		Nob High School.
	</p>

	<p class="font-bold underline text-orange-500">Bachelor Degree Journey</p>
	<p class="ml-4">
		After graduation, I came to Phnom Penh to study Bachelor Degree. I joined Computer Science(CS)
		back then which is now called Computer Science and Engineering(CSE) at
		<a class="text-blue-500" href="https://www.rupp.edu.kh/">Royal University of Phnom Penh</a>.
	</p>
	<p class="ml-4">
		Based on my experience, CSE at RUPP was fun, also hard at the same time. School provided many
		good courses such as <i>Data Structure and Algorithms</i>, <i>C#</i> and <i>JAVA</i>. I joined
		CS at Generation 22nd, the first year I found that Math Computing is the hardest on among other
		course,
		<a class="text-blue-500" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> is the
		most fundamental to get started in Programming, I found it was very hard to catch up. fun fact, at
		the very first session in the lab I couldn't write the Hello World Program.
	</p>

	<p class="ml-4">
		Second year, the year that was pretty hard for me <i>Data Structure and Algorithms</i> I was
		introduced to
		<a class="text-blue-500" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/">Stack</a>,
		<a class="text-blue-500" href="https://www.programiz.com/dsa/trees">Tree</a>, Queued,
		LinkedList, etc... but I can get 40% maybe out of it. C++ was introduced too but a very basic
		one but it still doesn't make sense to me. First semester went well and then pandemic hit. I
		went back to hometown, online class was pretty hard and we didn't get enough sessions from
		lecturers due to internet connection. so the second year went by.
	</p>

	<p class="ml-4">
		Third year, the pandemic was still alive so we were still do online class for the whole first
		semester. the second semester, the pandemic were getting a little less, I came back to town to
		find a part time job and still do online class. during my sophomore, I didn't have chance to
		focus on study much, all I wish was to survive the sophomore. I realized that working and
		studied at the same time was pretty hard if we didn't properly scheduled. my sophomore went not
		well.
	</p>

	<p class="ml-4">
		The final year, I decided to quit my part time job and focus on study. I would say that was the
		right decision for me. I determined that I will try my best to observe the knowledge. the
		coursed that the school provided were good of all time. such as Linux, SE & ITPM, Web
		Development, OOAD, and MIS. I was having enough time to review and get the homework done. I was
		doing pretty good in four year. I started to become a Ubuntu user(haha) which I still do these
		days.
